# Insta Helper

Insta Helper is a web application that simplifies Instagram posting by analyzing a photo and recommending a song (with a preview of its chorus) and a caption (for posts).

## Features

- Users can choose between Instagram "Post" (song + caption) and "Story" (song only).
- Upload a photo to get song recommendations and a caption based on the photoâ€™s sentiment.
- The song preview automatically plays (with a play/pause option).
- Regenerate buttons allow users to re-generate the song and/or caption if not satisfied.
- Uses a generative AI tool (Gemini API) for content recommendations.
- Front-end styling inspired by Instagram with pink and orange color accents.
- Back-end built with Node.js and Express.
